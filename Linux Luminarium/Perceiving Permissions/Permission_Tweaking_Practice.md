# Perceiving Permissions

## Permission Tweaking Practice
You think you can chmod? Let's practice!

### Objective 
This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If you get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and you can try again. If you get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you chmod /flag to make it readable for yourself :-)

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4Euzpsea2ACCmgGGIBfrG07PuF9.dFzN1QDLygjN0czW}`

- I first launched the challenge using the `/challenge/run` command and then from there onwards, I just followed the required conditions for the /challenge/pwn file and made the required changes to its permissions using the `chmod` command.
- At the end of the 8th round, I was able to make changes to the permissions of the flag file to make it readable by the user and then used `cat` to read the flag.

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat flag

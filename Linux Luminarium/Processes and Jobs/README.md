Computers execute software to get stuff done. In modern computing, this software is split into two categories: operating system kernels and processes, which we will discuss here. When Linux starts up, it launches an init (short for initializer) process that, in turn, launches a bunch of other processes which launch more processes until, eventually, you are looking at your command line shell, which is also a process! The shell, of course, launches processes in response to the commands you enter.

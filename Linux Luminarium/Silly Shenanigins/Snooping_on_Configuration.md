# Silly Shenanigins

## Snooping on Configurations
Even without making mistakes, users might inadvertently leave themselves at risk. For example, many files in a typical user's home directory are world-readable by default, despite frequently being used to store sensitive information. Believe it or not, your .bashrc is world-readable unless you explicitly change it!

```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l ~/.bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker 148 Jun  7 05:56 /home/hacker/.bashrc
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Since .bashrc is processed by the shell at startup, that is where people typically put initializations for any environment variables they want to customize. Most of the time, this is innocuous things like PATH, but sometimes people store API keys there for easy access. 

### Objective
In this level, users can use a valid API key to get the flag:

```bash
zardus@dojo:~$ flag_getter --key $FLAG_GETTER_API_KEY
Correct API key! Do you want me to print the key (y/n)? y
pwn.college{HACKED}
zardus@dojo:~$
```

Naturally, Zardus stores his key in .bashrc. Can you steal the key and get the flag?

### Solve 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{k1G67Frwz823_Xn2ATkJmmiczXe.QXyQTM3EDLygjN0czW}`

- In this challenge, I simply displayed the .bashrc file of zardus. There I found the API key.
- Then I ran the command `flag__getter --key` with the API key as its argument and got the flag.

### New Learnings
1. API keys are like passwords and can be used to get access into a users account. 
2. Many useful information can be extracted from the world readable files like the .bashrc of an account. They might contain API key or some other sensitive info that might help the hacker to get access into the account. 
3. Most of the files are world readable by default.
